*** game_01/ - Capture the goblin
game_01/ is in the base a pure copy of this tutorial: [[http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/]]

But with following modifications:
- You can't walk outside of the canvas
- The players position doesn't reset when the goblin is captured
- The goblin moves away from the player, but does't understand corners or have any "smart AI" at all.

*** game_02 - Jump on platforms
game_02/ is based on this tutorial: http://michalbe.blogspot.se/2010/09/simple-game-with-html5-canvas-part-1.html

But with following modifications:
- I haven't implemented scrolling, at all.
- The platforms does not appear at random and does have collision detection from bottom and the sides
- Implemented falling of platforms better
- My clouds moves at different speed depending on their size to make a fake-3d-feeling-effect

This could be a fairly simple platformer game without too much modifications, but I didn't bother.
