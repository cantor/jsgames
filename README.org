*** game_01/ is in the base a pure copy of this tutorial: [[http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/]]

- The players position doesn't reset when the goblin is captured
- The goblin moves away from the player, but does't understand corners or have any "smart AI" at all.
